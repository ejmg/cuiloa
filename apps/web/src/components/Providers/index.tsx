  //       there is no Suspense boundary between the instantiation (here) and the context that is being wrapped; however, it is more or less considered best practice to
  //       use useState for QueryClient because... this is how you keep a stable reference to the client. I believe it is safe to use useState here because
  //       NextJS, in theory, injects a React.Suspense boundary around app/page.tsx when loading.tsx is provided (as I have). This is a detail that goes undocumented and
  //       unconnected in the reference docs for using this functionality with NextJS itself. If this note is confusing/unnerving, then you are having a healthy response
  //       to the current state of the core React ecosystem. I am being serious. This is what passes for non-beta software.

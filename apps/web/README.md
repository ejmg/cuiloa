# cuiloa

A block explorer for [Penumbra](https://penumbra.zone/). Written with NextJS and PrismaJS. 

## Getting Started

A docker compose file is provided.

```
docker compose up
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
If you want to set up the pieces manually, see below.

### PostgreSQL

With a modern version of PostgreSQL, create a database and initialize it with the schema file provided by `cometbft` [here](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/main/state/indexer/sink/psql/schema.sql). Assuming you've created a database `$DB_NAME` and you have user permissions for the database, You can load a schema file using `psql` with the following command:

```sh
psql -d $DB_NAME -f schema.sql
```

This will be our indexer that the block explorer uses for accessing information on blocks, events, and transactions that occur on the chain. 

With the database initialized, create an .env file with the database's URI, i.e.:
```sh .env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://DB_USER:DB_PASSWORD@localhost:DB_PORT/DB_NAME?sslmode=disable"
```

You will also need this information for the `config.toml` file that `cometbft` will be initialized with when creating your own full node. More on that below.

### Penumbra

You need to have a full node setup with penumbra (including `cometbft`) as detailed [here](https://guide.penumbra.zone/node/pd/join-network). Alternatively, you can configure a full node on a devnet as explained [here](https://guide.penumbra.zone/main/dev/devnet-quickstart.html). **In either case**, you need to modify the `config.toml` file that is created by `pd` after generating your configuration files.

`config.toml` should be found under `$HOME/.penumbra/network_data/node0/cometbft/config/`. In this file, there is a heading `[tx_index]` with the configuration variable of `indexer = "kv"`. Using the URI of the database you created with PostgreSQL from the previous section, you need to update the section under `[tx_index]` to the following:

```toml
[tx_index]
indexer = "psql"
psql-conn = "$YOUR_DB_URI_HERE"
```
After you have updated this file, you should start the full node as instructed by the Penumbra guide. If everything was configured correctly, you should be able to open the database and inspect for Block and Transaction events. If there is no data, check the logs for `cometbft` for any errors with inserting data into the indexer.

### Block Explorer

A justfile has been provided for convenience and will be updated in the future to include project setup and configuration. Otherwise, install the project with your choice of JS package manager and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or whatever port that NextJS binds to) with your browser to see the website.

As of now, you can paste a hash of a transaction to view information about its corresponding block height, creation date, transation result, and related ABCI event attributes (such as Note Commitments and Nullifiers)
